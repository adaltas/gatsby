# Remark pluging to insert non-breaking spaces before characters

Remark NBSP (for No-Break Space) is a Remark plugin written in TypeScript to place non-breaking spaces before the special characters `:;?!â€¦`.

In some languages such as French, any character made of two or more elements is preceded by a space. In some cases, line wrapping leads to lines starting with punctuation characters which is not desirable.

To remedy this situation, the plugin inserts a non-breaking space before such characters.

The plugin has no option.
